Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately solves both problems as described in the Chapter Content/Questions. Challenge 1 correctly generates a list of multiples, and Challenge 2 effectively removes consecutive duplicate letters from a given string.
- readability: The code is well-formatted and easy to understand with descriptive variable names and comments.
- performance: The code has optimal performance for the given tasks. Challenge 1 iterates a fixed number of times and Challenge 2 iterates once through the string.
- security: The code does not have any known security vulnerabilities.
