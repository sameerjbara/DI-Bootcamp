# Exercise 1: Converting Lists into Dictionaries
# Key Python Topics:

# Creating dictionaries
# Zip function or dictionary comprehension


# Instructions
# You are given two lists. Convert them into a dictionary where the first list contains the keys and the second list contains the corresponding values.



# Lists:

# keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
# values = [10, 20, 30]


# Expected Output:

# {'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30}

keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
values = [10, 20, 30]

result = dict(zip(keys, values))
print(result)


# Exercise 2: Cinemax #2
# Key Python Topics:

# Looping through dictionaries
# Conditionals
# Calculations


# Instructions
# Write a program that calculates the total cost of movie tickets for a family based on their ages.

# Family members’ ages are stored in a dictionary.
# The ticket pricing rules are as follows:
# Under 3 years old: Free
# 3 to 12 years old: $10
# Over 12 years old: $15


# Family Data:

# family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}


# Loop through the family dictionary to calculate the total cost.
# Print the ticket price for each family member.
# Print the total cost at the end.

family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}

total_cost = 0

for name, age in family.items():
    if age < 3:
        price = 0
    elif 3 <= age <= 12:
        price = 10
    else:
        price = 15

    print(f"{name} pays ${price}")
    total_cost += price

print(f"Total cost: ${total_cost}")


# Bonus:

# Allow the user to input family members’ names and ages, then calculate the total ticket cost.

family = {}
total_cost = 0

while True:
    name = input("Enter name (or 'done' to finish): ")
    if name == "done":
        break

    age = int(input(f"Enter age for {name}: "))
    family[name] = age

for name, age in family.items():
    if age < 3:
        price = 0
    elif age <= 12:
        price = 10
    else:
        price = 15

    print(f"{name} pays ${price}")
    total_cost += price

print(f"Total cost: ${total_cost}")


# Exercise 3: Zara
# Key Python Topics:

# Creating dictionaries
# Accessing and modifying dictionary elements
# Dictionary methods like .pop() and .update()


# Instructions
# Create and manipulate a dictionary that contains information about the Zara brand.



# Brand Information:

# name: Zara
# creation_date: 1975
# creator_name: Amancio Ortega Gaona
# type_of_clothes: men, women, children, home
# international_competitors: Gap, H&M, Benetton
# number_stores: 7000
# major_color: 
#     France: blue, 
#     Spain: red, 
#     US: pink, green


# Create a dictionary called brand with the provided data.
# Modify and access the dictionary as follows:
# Change the value of number_stores to 2.
# Print a sentence describing Zara’s clients using the type_of_clothes key.
# Add a new key country_creation with the value Spain.
# Check if international_competitors exists and, if so, add “Desigual” to the list.
# Delete the creation_date key.
# Print the last item in international_competitors.
# Print the major colors in the US.
# Print the number of keys in the dictionary.
# Print all keys of the dictionary.

brand = {
    "name": "Zara",
    "creation_date": 1975,
    "creator_name": "Amancio Ortega Gaona",
    "type_of_clothes": ["men", "women", "children", "home"],
    "international_competitors": ["Gap", "H&M", "Benetton"],
    "number_stores": 7000,
    "major_color": {
        "France": "blue",
        "Spain": "red",
        "US": ["pink", "green"]
    }
}

# Change number_stores
brand["number_stores"] = 2

# Print sentence
print(f"Zara clients include: {', '.join(brand['type_of_clothes'])}")

# Add country_creation
brand["country_creation"] = "Spain"

# Add Desigual if competitors exist
if "international_competitors" in brand:
    brand["international_competitors"].append("Desigual")

# Delete creation_date
brand.pop("creation_date")

# Print last competitor
print(brand["international_competitors"][-1])

# Print US colors
print(brand["major_color"]["US"])

# Print number of keys
print(len(brand))

# Print all keys
print(brand.keys())

# Bonus:

# Create another dictionary called more_on_zara with creation_date and number_stores. Merge this dictionary with the original brand dictionary and print the result.

more_on_zara = {
    "creation_date": 1975,
    "number_stores": 7000
}

brand.update(more_on_zara)
print(brand)


# Exercise 4: Disney Characters
# Key Python Topics:

# Looping with indexes
# Dictionary creation
# Sorting


# Instructions
# You are given a list of Disney characters. Create three dictionaries based on different patterns as shown below:



# Character List:

# users = ["Mickey", "Minnie", "Donald", "Ariel", "Pluto"]

users = ["Mickey", "Minnie", "Donald", "Ariel", "Pluto"]

# Expected Results:

# 1. Create a dictionary that maps characters to their indices:

# {"Mickey": 0, "Minnie": 1, "Donald": 2, "Ariel": 3, "Pluto": 4}

dict1 = {user: index for index, user in enumerate(users)}
print(dict1)


# 2. Create a dictionary that maps indices to characters:

# {0: "Mickey", 1: "Minnie", 2: "Donald", 3: "Ariel", 4: "Pluto"}

dict2 = {index: user for index, user in enumerate(users)}
print(dict2)

# 3. Create a dictionary where characters are sorted alphabetically and mapped to their indices:

# {"Ariel": 0, "Donald": 1, "Mickey": 2, "Minnie": 3, "Pluto": 4}

sorted_users = sorted(users)
dict3 = {user: index for index, user in enumerate(sorted_users)}
print(dict3)
