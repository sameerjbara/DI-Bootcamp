# Exercise 3: What is the output?
# Instructions
# Predict the output of the following code snippets:
# Coment what is your guess, then run the code and compare

# Example:

# >>> 15 < 8 #False
# >>> 5 < 3
# >>> 3 == 3
# >>> 3 == "3"
# >>> "3" > 3
# >>> "Hello" == "hello"




15 < 8          # False
5 < 3           # False
3 == 3          # True
3 == "3"        # False
"3" > 3         # TypeError (cannot compare str and int in Python 3)
"Hello" == "hello"  # False
