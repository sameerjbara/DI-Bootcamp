1) What is a class?

A class is a blueprint or template used to define the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects will have.

2) What is an instance?

An instance is a concrete object created from a class. Each instance has its own data but shares the class’s structure and behavior.

3) What is encapsulation?

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data together, while restricting direct access to some of the object’s internal details (using private/protected attributes).

4) What is abstraction?

Abstraction focuses on exposing only the essential features of an object while hiding the complex implementation details, often using abstract classes or interfaces.

5) What is inheritance?

Inheritance allows a class (child/subclass) to reuse and extend the attributes and methods of another class (parent/superclass).

6) What is multiple inheritance?

Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from more than one parent class, gaining features from all of them.

7) What is polymorphism?

Polymorphism allows different classes to define methods with the same name but different behaviors, enabling objects of different types to be used interchangeably.

8) What is method resolution order (MRO)?

Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python searches for a method in a class hierarchy, especially important in multiple inheritance. Python follows the C3 linearization algorithm.
