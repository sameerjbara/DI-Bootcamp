suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding a play again option at the end of the game.
- The code is already well-structured, but consider using a class to represent the TicTacToe game. This would encapsulate the board and game logic within a single object.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements a Tic Tac Toe game, fulfilling all the requirements outlined in the chapter content, including displaying the board, handling player input, checking for a win, and managing the game loop. It adheres to the specified rules and provides a functional game experience.
- readability: The code is well-organized and easy to understand. The use of comments and descriptive variable names enhances readability. The function names clearly indicate their purpose, and the code is logically structured.
- performance: The performance is efficient for the scale of the Tic Tac Toe game. The code avoids unnecessary computations and uses appropriate data structures for the task.
- security: The code takes basic input validation and prevents invalid moves or errors. It does not involve any external data or network communication, minimizing potential security risks.
