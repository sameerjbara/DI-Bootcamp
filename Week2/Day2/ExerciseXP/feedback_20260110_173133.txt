suggestions for improvement:
- The code is well-organized and addresses each exercise correctly. Consider removing the comments that are copies of the instructions as they reduce readability. The separation of exercises is good.
- In exercise 6, the make_great function modifies the list in place. While this satisfies the prompt, it might be more robust to return a new list to avoid unexpected side effects. This is a style choice.
Brief justification:
- correctness: All exercises are implemented correctly and produce the expected output as described in the chapter content. The functions are defined and called as required, and the logic within each function accurately addresses the specific goal of the exercise.
- readability: The code is generally readable, with clear function names and straightforward logic. The excessive comments that mirror the instructions slightly detract from the readability. Removing these would improve clarity.
- performance: The code's performance is adequate for the scale of the exercises. There are no computationally intensive operations, and the code executes quickly. For exercise 6, while modifying the list in place is acceptable, creating a new list and returning it can sometimes be better for avoiding side effects, though it doesn't drastically impact performance here.
- security: There are no security concerns in this code, as it does not handle any external input or perform any sensitive operations.
